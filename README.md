Problem Statement:
Financial markets are strongly influenced by news related to economic policies,
company announcements, and global events. Analyzing the sentiment of financial
news manually is time-consuming, subjective, and not scalable when handling
large volumes of information. There is a need for an automated system that can
consistently analyze financial news and determine market sentiment.

Problem Description:
This project develops an Agentic AI based system that autonomously analyzes
financial news headlines and classifies them as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
The system uses a goal-driven agent that decides how to apply multiple tools,
including a machine learning sentiment classifier and a Large Language Model.
Based on the outputs of these tools, the agent applies decision logic to produce
a final sentiment classification along with an explanation.
The solution demonstrates key Agentic AI concepts such as autonomous decision
making, tool usage, reasoning, and guardrails for handling uncertainty or
conflicting predictions.

Tech Stack:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, LangChain, OpenAI or HuggingFace 

Use Case:
Automated sentiment analysis of financial news headlines  
Market sentiment analysis for investors and analysts  
Decision support for financial and trading applications  
Reduction of manual effort in monitoring financial news  
Demonstration of Agentic AI in real-world financial scenarios
